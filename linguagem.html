In this simulation game, you
play the president of a video
game company.
Do your best to create a
million-selling game and
win the Grand Prize in the
Global Game Awards.
â–¼Game Flow
First, you'll need to hire
some employees. You can
start developing a game
to earn money, or take
contracting jobs and
focus on training your staff.
â–¼Research Data
The upper left floppy disk
shows your Research Data.
Earn more by developing
and debugging games. This
allows you to level up staff
and use boosts.
â–¼Contracting
If you do a contracted
job well, you will get money
and Research Data.
It's hard to make a lot of
money this way, but it
doesn't require any capital.
â–¼Game Development 1
First, you have to select a
game genre and type. The
combination of these will
have a big effect on sales.
You will need a license to
develop for a game console.
Erro:508
Next, you need a game
proposal. You can ask an
employee with scenario
writing experience, or
outsource it. Your choice
affects the game's quality.
Erro:508
During development, you'll
also have to add graphics
and sound. You can use
your own staff or outsource
these, but using someone
too often will tire them out.
â–¼Unlocking More Genres
The higher your staff's
job level, the more genres
you can develop in.
Genres may also be
unlocked due to the choices
you make in development.
â–¼Unlocking More Types
Depending on a staff
member's job, they may
unlock new game types
during training. Choices
you make in development
can cause types to level up.
â–¼Game Direction 1
When developing a game,
you must choose a game
direction. Even games with
the same genre and type
may sell differently due to
their direction.
Erro:508
This also affects your
company's reputation and
fan base. If a game's genre,
type, and direction match,
you may be able to level up
that genre or type.
â–¼Game Parameters 1
The games you develop all
have a set of parameters:
Fun affects sales, while
Creativity can help make
a hit. Graphics and Sound
are also very important.
Erro:508
Bugs are a game
developer's worst enemy.
Shipping a game with bugs
can lead to big problems.
Each time you fix a bug,
you get Research Data.
â–¼Leveling Up Your Staff
You can use Research Data
to level up your staff. This
increases their abilities
across the board, and may
unlock new genres, but it
also increases their salary.
â–¼Staff Parameters 1
â– Programming
This is an important all-
around parameter. It affects
development points and
gives bonuses to both
proposals and game art.
Erro:508
â– Scenario
Aids in getting Research
Data, and makes it easier to
make creative games.
Erro:508
â– Graphics / Sound
These affect the number of
development points you get.
â– Energy: Work and training
consume Energy. Staff with
zero Energy will go home.
â–¼Staff Jobs
Each employee has a job,
such as Programmer or
Director. Jobs affect an
employee's parameters and
the genres that may be
unlocked during training.
â–¼Changing Jobs
Using a particular item will
make it possible for a staff
member to change jobs.
There are also advanced
jobs that are only open to
staff of level 5 or above.
â–¼Staff Salaries
When you hire an employee
you must pay an initial
contract fee. You must also
pay them a yearly salary at
the end of March. Leveling
up increases staff salaries.
â–¼Company Fans
Your fans are divided into
age groups, and can affect
the sales of your games.
Fans age as time passes, so
you'll have to try and appeal
to new young gamers, too.
â–¼Advertising
You can increase your fan
base by advertising, but
some kinds become less
effective over time. Putting
out good games is the best
way to attract more fans.
â–¼Items
You will occasionally be
visited by a salesman who
sells various items that can
improve in-progress games.
Some items disappear after
you use them.
â–¼Your Own Console
If your company is large
enough and has a hardware
engineer, you can release
your own console. Use your
fan base to become the king
of the game industry!
â–¼The Key to Creating a Hit
The combination of genre
and type are very important.
Also, sales tend to spike
during the winter holidays,
so the timing of a release
also affects its success.
â–¼Global Game Awards
A number of prizes are
given during these awards,
which are held yearly. If
you get the Grand Prize,
it means that you're one of
the pillars of the industry.
â–¼Ending
The game â€œendsâ€ after 20
years have passed. Your
total assets at this point will
be saved as your high
score. However, you can
continue playing after this.
â–¼Other Notes
The level that you reached
for each game genre and
type are carried over from
one game to the next. Also,
keep an eye out for some
secret characters to hire...

At last, it's time to start game development. Good luck!
This should be a popular combination. I'm looking forward to seeing it finished.
What a great combination!! Your staff is very excited to get to work on this one!
That's a bit of an odd combination. I'm sure you can pull it off, but...
That genre and type don't go together at all... I hope it sells...
That's a bizarre combination... I wonder how this will turn out...

Kill it! Kill it with fire!
Oh... My... God...
I'd give it a zero if I could.
We're all speechless...
Can I get a refund?
Ouch...
It went right to the trash.
Oh dear...
What the heck is this?!
The idea isn't bad, but...
They need more practice.
Better luck next time.
Why'd they do this to us?
Not bad. But not good.
I got paid to play it, so...
Still needs work.
Try again.
This shows promise!
Rethink the combination.
They worked hard on it.
#NOME?
Needs work, technically.
I like this kind of game.
It's an interesting idea!
I'm a little disappointed...
Close. Try harder.
Good idea. I enjoyed it.
Good overall.
Some people may like it.
Title screen wasn't bad...
Look forward to a sequel.
Good, but limited appeal.
Too short.
This is pretty good!
It all needs more work.
It's for hardcore gamers.
Needs more polish.
It's easy to play, but...
Not bad. But not great.
Not for most players.
It looked fun.
I got really hooked.
Rough around the edges.
It's pretty well done.
So close and yet so far...
They do good work.
A bit rough, but creative.
Nice. What's next?
They've come a long way.
It's a fun combination.
Its content was good.
I had a lot of fun with it!
A little rough, but good.
I give it a â€œbuy.â€
Best game of the year.
My pick of the week.
Good. Could be better.
Needs a twist.
I could play this for days.
Has lots of personality.
A guaranteed hit!
I had a ball with this one!
An instant classic!
They did a great job.
I play this one every day!
Everybody loved it!
A rare masterpiece!!
I was about to cry!
I can't wait to play more!
Perfect!
It's... so beautiful...!
Amazing! I'm impressed!
This'll go down in history!
A masterpiece!!
The game of the century!
I bought 3 copies myself.
An amazingly large game!
Perfect in every way.
I'll ask around and see what I can find!/I'll let you know if I hear of any promising candidates.
I just took out an ad in a game magazine./We should get a number of applicants soon, so just wait a bit.

Another proposal? I'm not sure I can give this one my best...

Another soundtrack? I'm not sure I can give this one my best...
I'm afraid we can't allow a company with no experience to have a license for our console./Why don't you start out by developing some PC games?
That's pretty low...|Let's try to get a better score next time.
Those aren't great scores...|But maybe the players won't mind. Let's hope it sells.
Those scores are pretty low...|But not everybody listens to the critics. Let's just see if it sells!
Looks like it could've used a bit more work.|But it may sell well, depending on how we promote it!
Those are pretty good scores!|I can't wait to see how well this one sells!
Those are great scores!|Maybe our next game will be in the Hall of Fame!
We almost got in the Hall of Fame!|Scores like this should really help our sales!
It didn't make it into the Hall of Fame...|I guess this will be the last entry in the series...
The alpha version of the current game is now finished. It's time to really start working on the graphics./Who should we put in charge of character design?
The beta version of the current game is now complete. We should start paying attention to the sound now.
/You can either choose a designer on your staff, or outsource it to an outside specialist.

Hello!/I'll be your secretary here at <0>./I look forward to working with you, whether you're an expert or this is your first time./I'll do whatever I can to help you make a best-selling game.|Maybe we can even win the Grand Prize in the Global Game Awards!/If you ever have any questions, just tap â€œSystemâ€ on the game menu and select â€œManual.â€/First of all, you'll need to hire some employees.|Open the menu and select â€œStaffâ€ > â€œHire.â€
The fiscal year just ended. Normally, you'd have to pay your staff's salary at this point./However, this year the government is going to pay to encourage development of the game industry!/You'll have to pay starting next year, so make sure you have enough cash available.
The fiscal year is almost over./You will have to pay your staff's salaries at the end of March./You should make sure you have enough money available.
You leveled up one of your staff members./When you level up an employee, their parameters go up and you may unlock new game genres./But their salary also goes up, make sure you have enough money to pay them!
On this screen you can adjust the direction of a game that you are developing./Depending on the direction you choose, the genre or game type my go up in level./Also, the choices that you make over time will help you attract new fans.
Congratulations on starting your first game!/Who should we have write the game proposal?/You can either use a scenario writer on staff, or hire an outside expert.
/Now you will start the debugging process./Each time you fix a bug you will get Research Data, which you can use to level up your staff./Also, on the game information screen you have the option to ship a game without fixing all of the bugs.
/You've got a fair number of younger fans. If you take advantage of this, you may be able to expand your entire fan base.

Hello. I'm a representative of Items & Things./The items we sell are very useful, and they are priced accordingly./Boost items require Research Data to use, but can be used any number of times.

It's almost time for Gamedex again./It's always a good chance for us to get our name out there.|Will we be attending this year?
Oh no!|There's been a blackout! Our current game has lost some points...
Oh no!|There's been a blackout!/But since you don't have any games in development, it didn't have any effect.
We're getting a little low on capital.../It looks like we're going to have to dip into our emergency fund of $150K./If you run out of money while developing a game, you may even have to cancel the project./This is all the money we have, so if you find yourself running low, select â€œDevelopâ€ > â€œContractâ€ to get a job.

The Secret of Boosts
After an extensive investigation by our game team, we have discovered the secret to the items known as â€œBoosts.â€|First, it seems as though Boosts become progressively more expensive with each one you purchase.|In addition, the amount of Research Data required to use a Boost depends on the total amount of data your company has accumulated.|They say that the most successful companies are also the best at using Boosts, so if you haven't tried it, we suggest you do.
You've got quite a lot of cash at your disposal now!/But you still have to be careful about how you use your funds./Consider investing in advertising to expand your fan base and secure the company's future.

|I'm sure it's not easy work, but do your best. Goodbye.
|I've recommended your company to all my friends, so please work hard on your next games.
I loved how much <0> the game had!
|I like <0> games in general, and I really enjoyed that this one was a <1> game.
|I thought combining a <0> game with a <0> game might not work, but it was very addictive.
|I like games like <0>, and I'm really looking forward to your next game!
|I think the problem was that it didn't have enough <0>.
My friends didn't seem to like it much...
|I was really looking forward to a new <0> game, but it wasn't that much fun... 
|This game may not have been much fun, but I'm sure the next one will be better if you use a different combination.
|I enjoyed the game, but I think it could have been even better with a different combination.
|None off my friends really knew what to make of the game, so I hope you choose a better combination next time. I'll be cheering for you!
|I was pretty disappointed, because I enjoyed your other games. I'm thinking about not being your fan anymore... Bye.
|I guess most people don't like the combination of a <0> game and a <0> game, but some people really like that kind of thing. I hope the games you make in the future will surprise me--in a good way!
|I think the combination of a <0> game and a <0> game just doesn't work very well...

Hardware Development
It seems that <0> has started development on its own console.|Their recent hire of a hardware engineer had sparked rumors in the industry, and it appears the rumors were right.|Of course, once development is finished, things like the number of the company's fans and the talent of its employees will determine how well it sells.|We'll be waiting to see if they'll be able to replicate their past success with this new venture.

Game Market Heats Up
Charismatic Staff
1 Million Units Sold
The recently released <0> has proven to be quite popular, reaching 1 million units sold in a very short period of time.|But consoles must continue to sell in order to be considered a success.|In many cases, a hit game prompts people to purchase a system.|Indeed, a single hit game can greatly change a console's fortunes.
Million-Hit Still Selling
The popular game <0> has now sold more than 1 million units.|This is the first <1> game in some time to reach this mark, and has proved quite popular even with people in the game industry. As one retail store owner put it, â€œIt sells out as soon as we put it on the shelves. I've been playing it to try and discover why it's so popular, and now I'm hooked. Now my sales are suffering...â€ One can only wonder how many units it will end up selling.
Monster Hit At 2 Million
The popularity of <0> continues unabated. Indeed, it recently topped 2 million in sales!|<1> certainly put their all into this <2> game.|The game is still in short supply, with some shop owners saying that parents have resorted to buying other, similar games because they can't find the genuine article.
Game Industry Trends
Competition in the game industry continues to heat up as newcomer <0> enters the market.|We look forward to seeing what they have in store for us.|It will need to be impressive to make an impact in this crowded market.
Moving to Bigger Digs
<0> is riding the wave of its recent success by moving to larger offices.|Their new headquarters are said to be twice as big as the old ones, and their desks, chairs, and other furnishings are all brand new.|<1>, one of their employees, had this to say about their new digs: â€œIt's a wonderful office. I can't wait to come here every day and start to work making great games!â€
Big Sales, Big Office
Sources say that <0>, which should be a familiar name to any game fan by now, has recently moved to new offices.|The new offices are in a prime location near a train station and are carpeted with the finest Persian rugs.|The president commented that, â€œIt's my job to provide a workplace that brings out the best in our employees.â€ And indeed, it seems to be working--the company has been flooded with applications for work.
New Game Types
We here at Game Guy magazine have recently succeeded in interviewing a famous game developer.|According to him, the best way to increase the number of game types you have available is to train your employees.|Your employees' job types and levels also affect the types of games they can discover.|From what we understand, Scenario Writers are particularly good at discovering new game types, so you may want to try training yours.
#NOME?
<0>, which we have covered many times in the past, recently won <1> in the Global Game Awards!|The judges unanimously agreed on their choice and talked at length about the game's quality.|This will no doubt increase the company's fans and sales in the near future.
GGA Grand Prize
The Global Game Awards, which recognize the best in video games throughout the world, have chosen <0> to receive the Grand Prize.|Many <0> fans were present at the ceremony, and cried out in unison when the results were announced.|The entire industry is waiting to see what <0> will do next.
Masked Man?
According to information acquired by our magazine, a mysterious masked man has recently been seen trying to apply at various video game companies.|Our sources indicate that he is simply a hardworking guy in a mask, so companies should certainly give him a second look.
Missing King
A Middle Eastern oil baron disappeared during a recent trip to the consumer electronics district, and hasn't been seen since.|One of his servants looked up from the game he was playing long enough to talk to us. â€œWe knew that the king was obsessed with video games. He kept saying that he wanted to work at a game company, but we didn't think he'd actually try and do it!â€
Beast On The Loose
According to one of our reporters, a dangerous wild animal has recently escaped from a forested area in Kairo Park.|While the animal in question has only been sighted from far away, it is said to have long sharp claws and a vicious temperament. Please use caution if you see it.|The animal apparently has a fondness for video games, and so may be found if a company starts accepting new applicants.
A Job For Chimpan Z
We have just learned that Mr. Chimpan Z, a resident of an island on Kairo Park, is looking for employment.|The recent heatwave has apparently decimated the crop of bananas he was tending on the island, leading him to seek work in video game development.|Companies looking for employees may encounter him.
Kairobot
According to one of our sources, Kairobot, a robot from Kairo Park, is trying to join a game company.|He told us that he had gained a large amount of experience, and felt it was time for him to take this step. He said that he wanted to use his advanced AI technology to create an amazing simulation game. 
Bobby Anderson (15)
Hello. I'm a high school student and I love <0> games. In fact, I've been playing them so much, I failed my last math test!|I'm really looking forward to what you're going to put out in the future, so please work hard on them!|By the way, my favorite game is, um... <1>.
Amy Jackson (21)
Hi! I don't play games very much, but everybody on TV was talking so much about your brain training games that I finaly broke down and bought one.|I had my grandmother try it out, and the age of her brain went from 80 to 5!|I tried it myself, and now I'm smart enough to get into an Ivy League college!|You've got a fan for life!
Hank Wright (28)
I'm a professional race car driver. This is my first fan letter, so forgive me if it's hard to read...|I always use your racing game to practice a new track before actually getting into my car.|Thanks to you, I was able to come in 16th in the recent Chimpan Island Race. I recommend your game to all my friends.
Jim Hollingsworth (56)
I used to be a game developer myself in my younger days. Now I just play them, but I had to write in and say how much I enjoyed your latest shooter.|The average company couldn't come close to replicating that kind of perfection...|If I wasn't retired, I'd love to apply for a job at your company, but I guess I'll have to content myself with playing your games.
Beverly Kane (25)
I always play your company's games.|I especially enjoyed the trivia game you recently released. I never thought combining it with a <0> would work, but it was perfect!|I can't wait to see what you come up with next.
James Bonehill (15)
Hello. I first heard of <0> at the recent Gamedex show.|I was very impressed that someone was making games like yours, so I went to my local shop and bought a bunch of your games.|I'm pretty sure I'm the biggest <0> fan in my town now. I hope you'll keep surprising me with your games in the future.
Julie Jameson (29)
Gamedex was amazing! They really covered it a lot on TV, so I think most of my friends are fans of yours now.|I've been playing <0> games for a long time, and I was very impressed to see how far you've come.|I hope you won't let success go to your heads. Keep putting out the games we all love! Thanks.
First up is best graphical design.
The Best Design Award,<br>with a reward of $100K!
Next is the $100K Best Music Award!
Next is the $500K Runner Up Award!
Before we award the Grand Prize...
We must announce the Worst Game<br> Award, with a penalty of $300K!
Try not to receive that one again.
Now then, it's finally time<br>to announce the Grand Prize!
This year's Global Game<br>Awards Grand Prize goes to...
They will also receive<br>an award of $1 million!
Whether you received an award or not...
We hope you'll keep at it for next year!
Until then, good luck and good gaming!
You've missed the deadline!/I'm never using your company again!
You failed to complete your contracting job.../Your company's reputation has gone down...
The Energy of all of your employees has been restored./You will also receive more Research Data!
/I'm sorry you had to come all the way out here, but I'm afraid that we can't grant a license to a company with such little capital at hand. Why don't you come back when you've grown a bit more?
/Hmm... It looks like you've got enough capital.
/All right. I'll give you a license and development kit./I hope you'll develop some games that will help promote our console./Good luck!
Thank you!|I'll do my best from now on as a <0>!
<0>'s fan base throughout the country is shrinking...
<0>'s fan base throughout the country is growing!
Gamedex is now over.
We had a record number of visitors at the <0> booth: <1>!
The number of visitors at the <0> booth was <1>.
/I'm sure most of those visitors will end up buying our game!/We should definitely go to the show next year, too!
The first half of the development of our console is finished!/Now we will start the second half.
Our console is finally finished! Now all we have to do is give it a name and we can ship it./A console made by our company will never go off the market. Plus, you can increase console sales by releasing games for it.
<0> years have now passed. This ends the main portion of the game./<1> released <2> games and sold a total of <3> units./The top selling game was|<4>| with total sales of <5>./You can keep playing the game from now on. However, your high score (total capital) will no longer be updated from this point on./If you start a new game, you will be able to start playing using the current levels for game genre and type, which should make it easier to beat your high score next time.
But feel free to continue playing your current game to try and beat your top sales record!
I see they've released a new console. After we've built up some capital, we should try getting a license!
They're going to ship a lot of those. It looks like they're really trying to dominate the market. We should try to get in on the action, too!
This seems to be the successor to the popular IES console./We should definitely try and get a license!
This console seems to be focusing on 3D graphics.|They seem to be putting a lot of effort into promoting it. We'll definitely want to keep an eye on this one in the future.
This console is being put out by a company best known for its arcade games. I wonder how well it will sell.
This one doesn't seem like it will sell very well, and the license fees are very high, too.../But with relatively few companies developing for it, it might be easier to create a hit.
This is the successor to the wildly popular PlayStatus console. They said on TV that people have been lining up for days to buy it.
This is an impressive console! The license fees are high, but we should think about developing for it!
This console includes some very impressive technology./It's going on sale at the same time throughout the world, so our sales might get a boost!
Apparently you can control this console with a remote, and even use it to access the Internet.../It's unusual, but it might expand the game market to people who wouldn't normally play games!
It's pretty similar to other popular game systems, but there's something a little odd about this one.../Still, the license and development costs are relatively low.
Hmm... It doesn't look bad, but I'm not sure it will sell.../Depending on how the market reacts, it might be worth developing for this console.
This is a pretty unusual console... But they're going to be shipping a lot of them, so it might be worth developing for.
This unique console features many ports of arcade games.
Apparently you look through those goggles to see a three-dimensional image.../I'm not sure this one will sell very well...
This is the first portable game console! I bet it'll be especially popular with younger players!
This is a portable console with a color LCD screen./The portable game market is about to expand!
This cutting edge portable console has an impressive number of developers lined up!/We should really think about developing for it!
This console has a beautiful LCD screen and high capacity game discs./They're shipping it in large numbers, so I would suggest trying to get a license.
This unusual portable console has a touch screen and a stylus./They must be targeting children and families if they plan on shipping so many of them.
This one doesn't even look like a game console!/The optional â€œTP Controllerâ€ seems quite popular.
This console can apparently even explore the reaches of outer space!/I'm not sure how it is as a game console though...
